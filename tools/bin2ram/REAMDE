This is a simple script that helps with bootstrapping via the
simple ZDI debugger (../debugger).

Typing in machine code by hand is boring and error-prone ;-)

It depends on pexpect and talks to the debugger through a tty
such as /dev/ttyUSB0

It's quite slow due to the verbosity of the simple debugger.
This is not a big deal because we won't need it anymore when
we have the system at a point where it can reprogram itself
directly without the use of ZDI.
