This is the source for the code that runs on the microcomputer.

For now I'm still bootstrapping a standalone system.

Use the tools from Z88dk to compile/assemble.

Memory Map:

$0000..$BFFF unused
$C000..$F9FF code
$FA00..$FAFF string buffer
$FB00..$FBFF global system variables
$FC00..$FCFF interrupt vectors
$FD00..$FEFF sdhc sector buffer
$FF00..$FFFF stack
