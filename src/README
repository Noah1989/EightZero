This is the source for the code that runs on the microcomputer.

I have many plans for this but I'm not ready to write it all down yet.
For now I'm still bootstrapping a standalone system.

Use the tools from Z88dk to compile/assemble.

Memory Map:

$0000..$BFFF system ROM
$C000..$CFFF EMAC RAM / large buffer
$E000..      user code
     ..$F9FF user stack
$FA00..$FAFF string buffer
$FB00..$FBFF system globals
$FC00..$FCFF interrupt vectors
$FD00..$FEFF sdhc sector buffer
$FF00..$FFFF system stack
