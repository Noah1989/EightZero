What it is about those subdirectories?

"hacky" is the first version of the ROM code,
it has a very nice machine code monitor, good
keyboard, video, SPI and SDHC drivers, a
crappy FAT32 implementation and an unusable
editor. :D All these applications run on the
bare metal. I originally planned to take this
as far as having an assembler, but the lack of
proper operating system level services,
especially memory management and consistent
file abstraction, would make it too buggy.

"zinu" takes the experience from building
hacky and does the right thing (tm). Now
that I know which abstractions are useful,
the design should become very beautiful yet
efficient. The code is loosely based on the
XINU operating system, but hand-compiled
into eZ80 assembly. When zinu is mature, the
usable parts of hacky will be merged into it
and it will take its place in ROM.
